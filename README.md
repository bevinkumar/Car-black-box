# Car-black-box
The Car Black Box project logs critical driving events using a PIC18F microcontroller. It uses buttons to simulate actions like ignition, braking, and crash alerts. A 16x2 LCD displays real-time event messages to the driver. Events can be tracked, logged, and optionally stored for analysis.
